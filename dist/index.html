            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>30 March 1853 </strong>
                    <br>
                    Born in Zundert, Netherlands
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        At age 15
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    Van Gogh's family was struggling financially, and he was forced to leave school and go to work.
                    He got a job
                    at his Uncle Cornelis' art dealership, Goupil & Cie., a firm of art dealers in The Hague. By this
                    time, van Gogh was
                    fluent in French, German and English, as well as his native Dutch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        in 1872
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    He was transferred to Goupil's London branch on Southampton Street and took lodgings at 87
                    Hackford Road,
                    Stockwell.
                    This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work and, at 20, was earning more than his
                    father. Theo's
                    wife
                    later remarked that this was the best year of Vincent's life.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1873 </strong>
                    <br>
                    He fell in love with his landlady's daughter, Eugenie Loyer. When she rejected his marriage
                    proposal, van Gogh suffered a
                    breakdown. He threw away all his books except for the Bible, and devoted his life to God. He became
                    angry with people at work, telling customers not to buy the "worthless art," and was eventually
                    fired.

                    <strong> In August 1880</strong>
                    <br>Van Gogh returned to Cuesmes in August 1880, where he lodged with a miner until October. He
                    became interested in the
                    people and scenes around him, and he recorded them in drawings after Theo's suggestion that he take
                    up art in earnest.
                    He travelled to Brussels later in the year, to follow Theo's recommendation that he study with the
                    Dutch artist Willem
                    Roelofs, who persuaded him – in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art – to attend the
                    Académie Royale des
                    Beaux-Arts. He registered at the Académie in November 1880, where he studied anatomy and the
                    standard rules of modelling and perspective.

                        From 1880-1890
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    With all ups and downs in the life, he contributted a alot in the field of art. In this period,
                    he focused on his paintings but meanwhile he was shifting from one place to other.

                    <strong>
                        On 27 July 1890
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a 7mm Lefaucheux à broche revolver.There were
                    no witnesses and he
                    died 30 hours after the incident. The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which
                    he had been
                    painting, or a local barn. The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest
                    without doing apparent
                    damage to internal organs – probably stopped by his spine. But within hours Vincent began to fail,
                    suffering from an untreated infection resulting from the wound. He died in the
                    early hours of 29 July. According to Theo, Vincent's last words were: 'The sadness will last
                    forever'.

                    <strong>
                        On 30 July
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    Van Gogh was buried on 30 July, in the municipal cemetery of Auvers-sur-Oise. The funeral was
                    attended by Theo van Gogh,
                    Andries Bonger, Charles Laval, Lucien Pissarro, Émile Bernard, Julien Tanguy and Paul Gachet, among
                    twenty family
                    members, friends and locals. Theo had been ill, and his health began to decline further after his
                    brother's death. Weak
                    and unable to come to terms with Vincent's absence, he died on 25 January 1891 at Den Dolder and was
                    buried in
                    Utrecht. In 1914, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger had Theo's body exhumed and moved from Utrecht to be
                    re-buried alongside
                    Vincent's at Auvers-sur-Oise.
                    The gun Van Gogh was reputed to have used was rediscovered in 1965 and was auctioned, on 19 June
                    2019, as "the most
                    famous weapon in art history". The gun sold for €162,500 (£144,000; $182,000), almost three times
                    more than expected.

                        Artistic development
                    </strong>
                    Van Gogh drew, and painted with watercolours while at school, but only a few examples survive and
                    the authorship of some
                    has been challenged. When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level. In early
                    1882, his uncle,
                    Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings
                    of The Hague. Van
                    Gogh's work did not live up to expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the
                    subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result. Van Gogh persevered; he
                    experimented with lighting in his studio
                    using variable shutters and different drawing materials. For more than a year he worked on single
                    figures – highly
                    elaborate studies in black and white, which at the time gained him only criticism. Later, they were
                    recognised
                    as early masterpieces.

                        Some of his paintings are:
                    </strong>
                    <br>

                    <strong>1. Père Tanguy (1887)</strong>
                    <br>
                    His Portrait of Père Tanguy (1887) shows his success with the brighter palette and is evidence of an
                    evolving personal
                    style.
                    <br>

                    <strong>2. The Night Cafe</strong>
                    <br>
                    According to Hughes, Van Gogh perceived colour as having a "psychological and moral weight", as
                    exemplified in the
                    garish reds and greens of The Night Cafe, a work he wanted to "express the terrible passions of
                    humanity". Yellow
                    meant the most to him, because it symbolised emotional truth. He used yellow as a symbol for
                    sunlight, life, and
                    God.
                    <br>

                    <strong>3. Still Life with Cabbage and Clogs </strong>
                    <br>
                    Still Life with Cabbage and Clogs was primarily an exercise in colour, surfaces and brushwork. It
                    must have been a great
                    challenge for Van Gogh to convey the different textures of the tabletop, the potatoes and the
                    fabric. It was Van Gogh's
                    first attempt and shows no sign as yet of the characteristic Van Gogh style.

                    Beach at Scheveningen in Stormy Weather, also known as View of the Sea at Scheveningen, is an early
                    oil painting by
                    Vincent van Gogh, painted at Scheveningen near The Hague in August 1882. It is held in the Van Gogh

                    Landscape with Dunes is an oil painting created in August 1883 by Vincent van Gogh during the time
                    he lived at The

                    <br>
                    A Girl in the Street, Two Coaches in the Background is an oil painting by Vincent van Gogh. It is
                    one of his very early
                    works, painted in The Hague in August 1882, at a time when his brother Theo was encouraging him to
                    paint landscapes in
                    colour, rather than drawing figures.

                    <strong>8. The Fourteenth of July Celebration in Paris </strong>
                    <br>
                    'The Fourteenth of July Celebration in Paris' was created in 1886 by Vincent van Gogh in
                    Post-Impressionism style.
                    Work period, between circa 1880 and circa July 1890.
                    <br>

                    <strong>9. Self-Portrait with Pipe </strong>
                    <br>
                    Van Gogh painted many self-portraits, more than 20 in Paris alone. In each one he looks different.
                    He saw these
                    self-portraits as a way of practising the art of portraiture. So he experimented with facial
                    expressions, colours and
                    forms.
                    <br>

                    <strong>10. Coal Barges </strong>
                    <br>
                    It shows a view of the Rhone with a blazing sunset in which the motifs of the composition— clearly
                    influenced by
                    Japanese art — stand out against the light. “I saw a magnificent and strange effect this evening,”
                    wrote Vincent to his
                    brother Theo from Arles at the beginning of August 1888. “A very big boat loaded with coal on the
                    Rhône, moored to the
                    quay. Seen from above it was all shining and wet with a shower; the water was yellowish-white and
                    clouded pearl gray;
                    the sky, lilac, with an orange streak in the west; the town, violet. On the boat some poor workmen
                    in dirty blue and
                    white came and went carrying the cargo on shore. It was pure Hokusai.
                    <br>

                    <strong>11. Starry Night Over the Rhône </strong>
                    <br>
                    Starry Night, commonly known as Starry Night Over the Rhône, is one of Vincent van Gogh's paintings
                    of Arles at night.
                    It was painted on the bank of the Rhône that was only a one or two-minute walk from the Yellow House
                    on the Place
                    Lamartine, which Van Gogh was renting at the time.
                    <br>

                    <strong>12. The Starry Night</strong>
                    <br>
                    The Starry Night is an oil on canvas painting by Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh.
                    Painted in June
                    1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,
                    just before sunrise,
                    with the addition of an imaginary village.
                    <br>

                    <strong>13. Bedroom in Arles </strong>
                    <br>
                    Van Gogh's Bedroom, or Bedroom in Arles, painting is of a room where one sleeps, and he wanted the
                    painting to put the
                    viewer's mind and imagination at rest. Upon entering the room, there is a bed to the right. Along
                    the wall to the right
                    is a chair, table with water on it, and a window overlooking the street.
                    <br>

                    <strong>14. Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background </strong>
                    <br>
                    The olive trees with
                    the white cloud and the mountains behind, as well as the rise of the moon and the night effect,
                    are exaggerations from the point of view of the general arrangement; the outlines are accentuated as
                    in some old
                    woodcuts.

                    <br>
                    Wheatfield with Crows is a July 1890 painting by Vincent van Gogh. It has been cited by several
                    critics as one of his
                    greatest works. It is commonly stated that this was van Gogh's final painting.

                    most famous and influential figures in
                    the history of Western art. In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil
                    paintings, most of
                    which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and
                    self-portraits, and
                    are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed
                    to the foundations
                    of modern art. He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental
                    illness, depression
                    and poverty."
